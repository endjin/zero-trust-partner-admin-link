# Introduction

DevSecOps & Zero Trust are central to endjin's Cloud Adoption Framework approach. Many of endjin's customers operate in regulated industries, and thus it is highly undesirable for external partners to have access to any environment that contains customer data. Although this does cause day-to-day complications for partners, it is also highly desirable, as it mitigates security and professional indemnity risks, and minimises GDPR obligations by limiting access. 

But operating in this Zero Trust way causes additional complications for partners who need ACR to maintain their Microsoft Partner Competencies, as the Partner Admin Link (PAL) approach is designed to prove that partner are actively driving consumption by proving that they have at least contributor rights to a subscription, resource group or resource.

This repository provides an approach for configuring Partner Admin Link in a Zero Trust way, that enables the customer to have protected subscriptions, but also allows the partner to prove that their workloads are running in those Zero Trust environments.
